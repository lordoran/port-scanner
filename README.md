## 6.Ability to identify services associated with open ports
### Port scanners with extended ability to identify associated services:
These port scanners are known for their ability to recognize and identify specific services running on open ports, allowing for vulnerability detection and security testing.
Nmap
Zenmap (graphical interface for Nmap)
Nessus
Metasploit
OpenVAS
GFI LanGuard

### Port scanners with basic ability to identify associated services:
These port scanners can provide information about open ports but are not specialized in identifying specific services associated with those ports. They can be useful for general port scanning and availability detection purposes.
