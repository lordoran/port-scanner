# Port-Scanner Clasification:
## Scan type: Horizontal or vertical
## Supported protocols: TCP, UDP, or both
## Scan speed: Slow, medium, fast
## Configuration flexibility: Level of customization of scanning parameters
## Methods of detecting open ports: Active or passive scanning
## Ability to identify services associated with open ports
## Result filtering options: Display only open ports, closed ports, or both
## Support for scanning IPv4 and/or IPv6 networks
## Ability to scan the complete range of ports (0-65535) or a specific set of ports
## Ability to ignore well-known ports
## Detection of firewall or Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)
## Identification of systems with anti-port scan protection (honeypots)
## Support for identifying protocol versions and software used on open ports
## Stealth scanning options (undetectable scanning)
## Ability to perform remote or local scans
## Support for authentication and scanning open ports within a protected network
## Detection of systems with rate-limiting or throttling for aggressive scans
## Ability to perform asynchronous (parallel) scans for faster response times
## Ability to save and analyze previous scan results
## Support for stealth mode scanning to avoid detection in security logs
## Ability to perform scans using obfuscation methods (e.g., scanning through proxy servers)
## Identification of systems with vulnerable services on open ports
## Ability to generate detailed reports and graphics for scan results
## Support for signature-based scanning (e.g., identifying specific types of malware or specific attacks)
## Ability to perform highly parallel scans to quickly cover a large number of IP addresses
## Support for scans in virtual private networks (VPN) or isolated networks
## Integration options with other security tools or platforms
## Ability to perform scans based on custom port lists
## Detection of systems using port hiding techniques (port knocking, reverse port knocking)
## Scan aggressiveness: from passive and undetectable scans to aggressive scans that may impact network performance or trigger security alarms.
